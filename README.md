This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Purpose:
I helped Sam refine his full stack sample project from https://www.upgradingangularjs.com/ so with this project, I converted his final frontend version that was in Angular (the framework I've used on several large projects) over to React. Personally, I learn more from doing, when I'm actively engaged. I also figured this would be a good project for me to iterate on, like in the future, I'd like to add in Jest for unit testing, maybe Redux then Redux Saga, and some type checkign, like Flow. The demo app's backend needs some more work since not all of the api requests are currently available, so I might dig into that.
